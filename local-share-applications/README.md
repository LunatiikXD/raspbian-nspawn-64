## Desktop Files

This directory contains the various desktop files added for user pi
(on the Raspbian host OS) on the image (from `/home/pi/.local/share/applications`). The icons for these may be found [here](https://github.com/sakaki-/raspbian-nspawn-64/tree/master/usr-local-share-pixmaps).

They would need packaging for production use.
