## Pixmaps (Desktop Icons)

This directory contains the various pixmaps cited by [custom desktop files](https://github.com/sakaki-/raspbian-nspawn-64/tree/master/local-share-applications)
(on the Raspbian host OS) on the image (from `/usr/local/share/pixmaps`).

They would need packaging for production use.
