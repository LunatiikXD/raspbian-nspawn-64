## Licenses

This directory only includes the main non-'free' (in the FSF sense) licenses required by packages on the image.
However, the majority of packages in Raspbian and Debian are distributed under 'free'
(but still legally binding) licenses, such as the GPLv2 or v3.

A full list
may be found by browsing the Debian and Raspbian package sites; a
license summary, produced via daald's [`dpkg-licenses`](https://github.com/daald/dpkg-licenses) tool (for both host and
guest OSes) has been included here for convenience; please see:
* [raspberry_licenses.txt](https://github.com/sakaki-/raspbian-nspawn-64/blob/master/licenses/raspbian-licenses.txt); and 
* [debian_licenses.txt](https://github.com/sakaki-/raspbian-nspawn-64/blob/master/licenses/debian-licenses.txt).
